row-polymorphism
================

Example row-polymorphism implementations.

* AlgorithmW_Records.hs - an implementation of Daan Leijen's "Extensible Records with Scoped Labels".
* AlgorithmW_ConstrainedRows.hs - an implementation of extensible records and variants using type variable constraints to prevent repeated labels.
* AlgorithmW_Effects.hs - an implementation of row-polymorphic effect types using the above constrained-rows implementation.

NOTE:
